# Internet Application Development with Java: Treasure Hunt

The application system is an entertainment tool designed for teaching staff, mainly teaching assistant. It helps users to take a rest from the strenuous work of grading and assessing. Study has shown that a free play from work not only provides fun but also encourages brain integration and mastering of new skills (Dunkley 2017)[^fn1], as well as preventing muscle fatigue, chronic neck and back pain. This can help smoothen the assessment grading process with a relaxing experience.

## Technology

[Java SE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
You need to choose the platform of your home machine. For example, Windows x86 for Windows 8 (32 bits) version.

## Run

Download the game and image folder. Run the Main.java under game on a Java IDE e.g. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Game Instructions

The game is intended for one player use only. The player has to input his name and click start button to activate the game. He controls the main character whose mission is to search for the treasure in order to get the score. 

There are two types of objects appeared on the screen: Treasure (Professor) and bomb (Student). The two objects appear together every time at a new random position when either one is being found. 100 marks will be added for finding the treasure while 50 marks will be subtracted when the bomb is hit. Another element is the facilities at LSK Business Building, such as classrooms, escalators etc. The character must not hit the facilities , or game over otherwise.

Player controls the movement of character by using the keyboard arrow keys. For example, when forward key is pressed, the character will keep walking forward until another direction key is pushed.

There will be a 3-minute count down for the game. Scores and leader board will also be displayed at the bottom for playerâ€™s reference. When time is up or the character lost his life due to the crashing of facilities, the game ends with showing the total score.

## Expected Warnings
